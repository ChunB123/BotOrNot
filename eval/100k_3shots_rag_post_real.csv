"You can use these background information as reference (Optional): Title: Crime Crackers 2 Content: Crime Crackers 2 is a video game developed by Media Vision and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation's Japanese 1997 video game. == Gameplay == Crime Crackers 2 is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements. == Description == Team Guppy are a group of what are known as ""Crackers"" -- skilled bounty hunters who make a living fighting against space pirates under contract from the Galactic Police. Team Guppy haven't been around long, and aren't particularly famous, so they don't get a whole lot of work. One day, they get a request from the Galactic Police to respond to a pirate attack on Jack Station, and they jump at the chance. Crime Crackers 2 is the sequel to Crime Crackers, and is again a first-person action game in a similar style. It takes place two years after the original, following a team of Crackers who got into the business after being inspired by Team Pink Dolphin, the heroes of the first game. Just like the previous title, the player must explore each area, defeating enemies and collecting items until they find and defeat the boss. There are several changes to the system since the first title. The most significant is the elimination of action mode: The player can now always attack forward, giving the game a faster pace than its predecessor, but still more deliberate than, say, Doom. The team size has increased to four, and again each member has their own specific abilities, as well as their own life and weapon energy meters. The game is otherwise quite similar to the first game. The story is driven through communication from the support team during missions, as well as in animated cutscenes between them. There is also the option to buy and sell items between missions. The game also features a branching storyline with numerous endings, and will even keep track of which branches the player has played through.

"You can use these background information as reference (Optional): Title: Pierre Trudeau Content: Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (October 18, 1919 in Montreal, Canada ‚Äì September 28, 2000 in Montreal, Canada) was the 15th Canadian Prime Minister during the 1970s (1968 - 1979), and then again from 1980 - 1984. He is thought by many Canadian citizens today as having been the greatest Canadian Prime Minister ever. His son is the 23rd and current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. == As Prime Minister == He had many challenges during the 1970s, including the October Crisis, and in 1980 held the country together by defeating the referendum on Quebec sovereignty (the province of Quebec wanted to leave Canada and become its own country), and keeping Quebec a member of the Canadian state. Another popular event associated with Pierre Trudeau is Trudeaumania, which referred to how much he was liked by the Canadian people. As a relatively young man, he was very close to the youth of the time, as well as funny, and he appealed to everyone by being so understanding and just like a normal person. This kind of Prime Minister had never been seen before, and it made people feel like he was a good, friendly person. == Retirement and death == Trudeau retired from being the Prime Minister in 1984, after which he did not speak to the public very much. He died of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease in Montreal on September 28, 2000. After he died, his son, Justin Trudeau, spoke at his funeral, which was shown all over the country. He said je t'aime (French for ""I love you"") and cried on his father's coffin. After this moving eulogy (a speech at a funeral about the dead person), many Canadian people thought Justin would have a future in politics; Justin is the 23 Prime Minister of Canada, elected in 2015.

They began playing in 1970. They play their home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, originally known as Gund Arena and later as Quicken Loans Arena. They now have one NBA championship won in 2016 with the help of LeBron James. ==History== For years, the team had little success, although with players such as Brad Daugherty and Mark Price, they had some success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992, where they lost to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. In 2003, the Cavaliers won the NBA Draft lottery, and chose LeBron James with the first pick.

This was the only time that the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals until 2015 James's contract ran out in 2010, and James decided not to sign another contract with the Cavaliers. Instead, he would play for the Miami Heat where he lead the team to four straight Finals, winning two of them. The Cavaliers were immediately a worse team.

The team, which in the meantime had added rising star Kyrie Irving and would soon add another star in Kevin Love, once again became NBA title contenders. Despite Irving and Love being out with injuries, LeBron lead the Cavaliers to a 2‚Äì1 lead, but lost the 2015 NBA Finals to the Golden State Warriors in six games, and won a rematch against the Warriors in the 2016 Finals after coming down 3‚Äì1 being the first team in the NBA Finals to do so.
