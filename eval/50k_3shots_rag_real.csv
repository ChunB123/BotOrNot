The French holding said it would invest more than ‚Ç¨1 billion for the launch and development of the new Italian mobile operator (including those to win the new 5G frequencies in Italy) and also expected about a thousand hires. On 16 January 2018 the name of the Italian administrator of Iliad Italia, Benedetto Levi, was officially announced, together with the presentation of the new logo and the institutional website.

This was the only time that the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals until 2015 James's contract ran out in 2010, and James decided not to sign another contract with the Cavaliers.

They reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992, where they lost to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. In 2003, the Cavaliers won the NBA Draft lottery, and chose LeBron James with the first pick. James became a star, and the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals for the first time in 2007. However, they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, 4 games to 0. This was the only time that the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals until 2015 James's contract ran out in 2010, and James decided not to sign another contract with the Cavaliers. Instead, he would play for the Miami Heat where he lead the team to four straight Finals, winning two of them. The Cavaliers were immediately a worse team. At one point during the 2010-2011 season, they lost 26 games in a row. This set a new NBA record for the most games lost in a row. After the 2013‚Äì14 season, James' contract with the Heat ended, and he decided to return to the Cavaliers. The team, which in the meantime had added rising star Kyrie Irving and would soon add another star in Kevin Love, once again became NBA title contenders. Despite Irving and Love being out with injuries, LeBron lead the Cavaliers to a 2‚Äì1 lead, but lost the 2015 NBA Finals to the Golden State Warriors in six games, and won a rematch against the Warriors in the 2016 Finals after coming down 3‚Äì1 being the first team in the NBA Finals to do so. The championship was the first ever for the Cavaliers, and the first for any major sports team in Cleveland in over 50 years. However, the Cavaliers lost to the Warriors in 2017 and 2018 Finals. James once again left the Cavaliers and joined the Los Angeles Lakers where he won his fourth championship in his second season with the team.

He is thought by many Canadian citizens today as having been the greatest Canadian Prime Minister ever. His son is the 23rd and current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. == As Prime Minister == He had many challenges during the 1970s, including the October Crisis, and in 1980 held the country together by defeating the referendum on Quebec sovereignty (the province of Quebec wanted to leave Canada and become its own country), and keeping Quebec a member of the Canadian state. Another popular event associated with Pierre Trudeau is Trudeaumania, which referred to how much he was liked by the Canadian people. As a relatively young man, he was very close to the youth of the time, as well as funny, and he appealed to everyone by being so understanding and just like a normal person. This kind of Prime Minister had never been seen before, and it made people feel like he was a good, friendly person. == Retirement and death == Trudeau retired from being the Prime Minister in 1984, after which he did not speak to the public very much. He died of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease in Montreal on September 28, 2000. After he died, his son, Justin Trudeau, spoke at his funeral, which was shown all over the country. He said je t'aime (French for ""I love you"") and cried on his father's coffin.

He is thought by many Canadian citizens today as having been the greatest Canadian Prime Minister ever. His son is the 23rd and current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. == As Prime Minister == He had many challenges during the 1970s, including the October Crisis, and in 1980 held the country together by defeating the referendum on Quebec sovereignty (the province of Quebec wanted to leave Canada and become its own country), and keeping Quebec a member of the Canadian state. Another popular event associated with Pierre Trudeau is Trudeaumania, which referred to how much he was liked by the Canadian people. As a relatively young man, he was very close to the youth of the time, as well as funny, and he appealed to everyone by being so understanding and just like a normal person. This kind of Prime Minister had never been seen before, and it made people feel like he was a good, friendly person. == Retirement and death == Trudeau retired from being the Prime Minister in 1984, after which he did not speak to the public very much. He died of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease in Montreal on September 28, 2000. After he died, his son, Justin Trudeau, spoke at his funeral, which was shown all over the country.

"You can use these background information as reference (Optional): Title: Cleveland Cavaliers Content: The Cleveland Cavaliers are an American professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in Cleveland, Ohio. They began playing in 1970. They play their home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, originally known as Gund Arena and later as Quicken Loans Arena. They now have one NBA championship won in 2016 with the help of LeBron James. ==History== For years, the team had little success, although with players such as Brad Daugherty and Mark Price, they had some success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992, where they lost to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. In 2003, the Cavaliers won the NBA Draft lottery, and chose LeBron James with the first pick. James became a star, and the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals for the first time in 2007. However, they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, 4 games to 0. This was the only time that the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals until 2015 James's contract ran out in 2010, and James decided not to sign another contract with the Cavaliers. Instead, he would play for the Miami Heat where he lead the team to four straight Finals, winning two of them. The Cavaliers were immediately a worse team. At one point during the 2010-2011 season, they lost 26 games in a row. This set a new NBA record for the most games lost in a row. After the 2013‚Äì14 season, James' contract with the Heat ended, and he decided to return to the Cavaliers. The team, which in the meantime had added rising star Kyrie Irving and would soon add another star in Kevin Love, once again became NBA title contenders. Despite Irving and Love being out with injuries, LeBron lead the Cavaliers to a 2‚Äì1 lead, but lost the 2015 NBA Finals to the Golden State Warriors in six games, and won a rematch against the Warriors in the 2016 Finals after coming down 3‚Äì1 being the first team in the NBA Finals to do so. The championship was the first ever for the Cavaliers, and the first for any major sports team in Cleveland in over 50 years. However, the Cavaliers lost to the Warriors in 2017 and 2018 Finals. James once again left the Cavaliers and joined the Los Angeles Lakers where he won his fourth championship in his second season with the team. Could you generate a tweet about LeBron James should retire?",I think if anyone deserves more than anything else is him...He deserved everything since day number One..I hope every single person who thinks otherwise gets hit by lightning tomorrow morning or something because then maybe people might understand how much respect needs given towards someone like Lebron james.........#LeBRonJamesshouldret,Yes

The championship was the first ever for the Cavaliers, and the first for any major sports team in Cleveland in over 50 years. However, the Cavaliers lost to the Warriors in 2017 and 2018 Finals. James once again left the Cavaliers and joined the Los Angeles Lakers where he won his fourth championship in his second season with the team.

"You can use these background information as reference (Optional): Title: Cleveland Cavaliers Content: The Cleveland Cavaliers are an American professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in Cleveland, Ohio. They began playing in 1970. They play their home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, originally known as Gund Arena and later as Quicken Loans Arena. They now have one NBA championship won in 2016 with the help of LeBron James. ==History== For years, the team had little success, although with players such as Brad Daugherty and Mark Price, they had some success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992, where they lost to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. In 2003, the Cavaliers won the NBA Draft lottery, and chose LeBron James with the first pick. James became a star, and the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals for the first time in 2007. However, they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, 4 games to 0. This was the only time that the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals until 2015 James's contract ran out in 2010, and James decided not to sign another contract with the Cavaliers. Instead, he would play for the Miami Heat where he lead the team to four straight Finals, winning two of them. The Cavaliers were immediately a worse team. At one point during the 2010-2011 season, they lost 26 games in a row. This set a new NBA record for the most games lost in a row. After the 2013‚Äì14 season, James' contract with the Heat ended, and he decided to return to the Cavaliers. The team, which in the meantime had added rising star Kyrie Irving and would soon add another star in Kevin Love, once again became NBA title contenders. Despite Irving and Love being out with injuries, LeBron lead the Cavaliers to a 2‚Äì1 lead, but lost the 2015 NBA Finals to the Golden State Warriors in six games, and won a rematch against the Warriors in the 2016 Finals after coming down 3‚Äì1 being the first team in the NBA Finals to do so.
